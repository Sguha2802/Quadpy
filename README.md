#Quadpy4

This is a package to calculate the time evolution of the two point correlators of bosonic quadratic hamiltonians for arbitrary number of bosons. quadpy contains built-in functions to simulate the dynamics of light-matter interaction for dipole oscillators inside photonic reservoirs. Quadpy can be directly installed by executing the following command from the terminal

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ quadpy4`

A tutorial for using quadpy is can be found in the following \hyperlink{notebook}{https://nbviewer.org/github/Sguha2802/Quadpy/blob/6a0222dd585a98c8ea74caab7e3a09fce11dc53f/Quadpy-Tutorial.ipynb}:
